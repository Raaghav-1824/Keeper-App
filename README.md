# Keeper-App Using ReactJS
This is a minimal Clone of Google Keep developed using React, JSX and React Hooks and styled using CSS and Material Design.
Google Keep is a note-taking app, and some of the features I've replicated include creating and deleting notes.

It won't be stored as I've not used any backend yet.
I've developed only the front-end part of the website. So, once you refresh the notes will disappear.
